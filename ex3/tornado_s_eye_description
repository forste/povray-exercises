the tornado's eye:

In my work I use recursions and loopse to create subsequent tornados.

The loop creates the most outer tornado by creating and stacking torus. Each torus's color as well as it's position and size are subject to randomization.

After all torus of the current tornado are created a recursive call is issued which creates a smaller tornado in the center of the previous one.

The recursion stops until a certain level has been reached. Current Configuration creates 4 Tornados with levels 100, 50, 25 and 12.

Background and light source are kept simple in order to focus on tornados.
